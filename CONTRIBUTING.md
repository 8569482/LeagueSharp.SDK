Contributing
===================
We love pull requests! Here's a simple guide on how to get started.

 1. Fork and clone LeagueSharp.CommonEx
 
  `git clone git@github.com:LeagueSharp/LeagueSharp.CommonEx.git`'
  
  
 2.  Push to your fork, and [submit a PR](https://github.com/LeagueSharp/LeagueSharp.CommonEx/compare)("pull request")


Here are some tips to get your pull request accepted.

 - Test your code.
 - Follow [C# Coding Conventions.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396)
 - Write a good commit message, that briefly explains the changes you made.
 - Try your best not to spam commit messages.

Now after this, we will review the changes, ask you to change certain things, and then accept/deny the pull request.
